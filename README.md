# ARM-2-ARM-Serial-Communication
This project is done as a part of EE2016-Microprocessors Theory and Lab Course offered by Prof. R. Manivasakan in the Jul-Nov 2019 semester. We note the underlying concepts and protocols, used in serial communication and demonstrate serial communication in ARM through UART Port. We have successfully transmit 32x32 pixel image serially from one PC to another PC using two Vi-ARM LPC2378 processors. We have not encountered any loss in data.
